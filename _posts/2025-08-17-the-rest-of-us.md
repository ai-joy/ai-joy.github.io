title: "The rest of us"
---

Consider this - yours is the last community left on Earth, and all the rest have vanished from its face in a moment of a strange catastrophe. Somehow, all the resources that one needs to thrive, have also survived this disaster. So there is plenty for everyone of you. Do you think your community will leave in peace forever? Your answer, depending on how much you've been indoctrinated about the superiority of your people, will range from a solid yes to a deeply annoyed no. Why, though?
If you think that I am referring to "your" people as though it were about a religion. Or people sharing a political belief. The truth appears to be more expansive. To get closer to it, let's try an exercise.

<hr/>

1. Think of the person you think yourself the closest to. They could be anyone. But someone that you identify with. Someone who has your back.
2. Now, think of three simple ways in which they are different. For example, they may be taller, heavier, and may be wears glasses.
3. Finally, imagine a situation where people with better eyesight are preferred in various ways and reinforced all the time, and you find yourselves and your bro in that situation.

How long will it be before this person turns on you? Or at least becomes envious.

An interesting observation here is that as long as there is any attribute that distinguishes two people, and there is preferential treatment by that attribute for any favorable situation (or if the contrapositive is true), there is bound to be a bone of contention between them. The fact that two people are different by at least some attributes - if nothing else, their names - is true by definition. This means, that the only way that friction can be avoided between them is if they do not receive any preferential (or unpreferential) treatment. In any such situation, the grieved party identifies with the epithet "the rest of us" (TROU).

In a majority of people of a particular faith, a group of a different faith will likely call themselves TROU. In a group of power-wielding simpletons, a bunch of intellectuals would identify as TROU.
