title: "The rest of us"

"These right-angled shapes have become really arrogant. They just take up all the spacei in the city", said one polygon with rounded-corners to another. "A time will come when they will become many more in number than us and takeover the world with their orthogonal ideas". It was true. The rectangles had been subdividing unnaturally. And while it sounded ridiculous to say that rounded-corner figures would become a minority in Shapetown anytime soon, the sight of long rows of highly organized squares and rectangles had started sending a shiver down the diagonals of these polygons. The last congress of the governing council of shapes at the local toolbar had seen tremendous show of force by the righties. While the rounded figures all quarrelled over their petty differences, these sharp shapes all voiced their angle in unison.

Consider this - yours is the last community left on Earth, and all the rest have vanished from its face in a moment of a strange catastrophe. Somehow, all the resources that one needs to thrive, have also survived this disaster. So there is plenty for everyone of you. Do you think your community will leave in peace forever? Your answer, depending on how much you've been indoctrinated about the superiority of your people, will range from a solid yes to a deeply annoyed no. Why, though?
If you think that I am referring to "your" people as though it were about a religion. Or people sharing a political belief. The truth appears to be more expansive. To get closer to it, let's try an exercise.

<hr/>

1. Think of the person you think yourself the closest to. They could be anyone. But someone that you identify with. Someone who has your back.
2. Now, think of three simple ways in which they are different. For example, they may be taller, heavier, and may be wears glasses.
3. Finally, imagine a situation where people with better eyesight are preferred in various ways and reinforced all the time, and you find yourselves and your bro in that situation.

How long will it be before this person turns on you? Or at least becomes envious.

An interesting observation here is that as long as there is any attribute that distinguishes two people, and there is preferential treatment by that attribute for any favorable situation (or if the contrapositive is true), there is bound to be a bone of contention between them. The fact that two people are different by at least some attributes - if nothing else, their names - is true by definition. This means, that perhaps the only way that friction can be avoided between them is if they do not receive any preferential (or unpreferential) treatment. In any such situation, the aggrieved party identifies with the epithet "the rest of us" (TROU).

In a majority of people of a particular faith, a group of a different faith will likely call themselves TROU. In a group consisting of mainly power-wielding simpletons, a bunch of intellectuals would identify as TROU. In a community of mostly C++ programmers, a group of Java programmers will feel outcast and think of themselves as TROU. I bet if the parts of your face could think for themselves, the eyes would likely consider their selves as TROU. Why is that?

If our relationship to everyone else is so fractal in nature, what then is the so called idea of <b>Freedom</b> that we love so much. We're not free to do as we please. And we certainly don't like the things that the next person does.

So what happens when a digital overlord that does NOT distinguish between people rises to power in the real world? (Notice, how I write when and not if). Who or what group would be TROU? Would it be just those that lose their jobs immediately? Would it be the victims of a much dreaded redistribution of wealth? Would it be
